# NetBox Device Type Library

## About this Library

This library is intended to be used for populating device types in [NetBox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox).
It contains a set of device type definitions expressed in YAML and arranged by manufacturer. Each file represents a
discrete physical device type (e.g. make and model). These definitions can be loaded into NetBox instead of creating
new device type definitions manually.

If you would like to contribute to this library, please read through our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) before
submitting content.

If you would like to automate the import of these devicetype template files, there is a **community based** python script
that will check for duplicates, allow you to selectively import vendors, etc. available here [minitriga/Netbox-Device-Type-Library-Import](https://github.com/minitriga/Netbox-Device-Type-Library-Import). **Note**: This is not related to NetBox in any official way and you will not get support for it here.

## Device Type Definitions

Each definition **must** include at minimum the following fields:

- `manufacturer`: The name of the manufacturer which produces this device type.
  - Type: String
- `model`: The model number of the device type. This must be unique per manufacturer.
  - Type: String
- `slug`: A URL-friendly representation of the model number. Like the model number, this must be unique per
  manufacturer.
  - Type: String
  - Pattern: `"^[-a-zA-Z0-9_]+$"`. Must match the following characters: `-`, `_`, Uppercase or Lowercase `a` to `z`, Numbers `0` to `9`.

>:test_tube: **Valid Example**:
>```
>manufacturer: Dell
>model: PowerEdge R6515
>slug: dell-poweredge-r6515
>```

The following fields may **optionally** be declared:

- `part_number`: An alternative representation of the model number (e.g. a SKU). (**Default: None**)
  - Type: String
> :test_tube: **Example**: `part_number: D109-C3`
- `u_height`: The height of the device type in rack units. Increments of 0.5U are supported. (**Default: 1**)
  - Type: number (minimum of `0`, multiple of `0.5`)
> :test_tube: **Example**: `u_height: 12.5` 
- `is_full_depth`: A boolean which indicates whether the device type consumes both the front and rear rack faces. (**Default: true**)
  - Type: Boolean
> :test_tube: **Example**: `is_full_depth: false`
- `airflow`: A decleration of the airflow pattern for the device. (**Default: None**)
  - Type: String
  - Options:
    - `front-to-rear`
    - `rear-to-front`
    - `left-to-right`
    - `right-to-left`
    - `side-to-rear`
    - `passive`
> :test_tube: **Example**: `airflow: side-to-rear`
- `subdevice_role`: Indicates that this is a `parent` or `child` device. (**Default: None**)
  - Type: String
  - Options:
    - `parent`
    - `child`
> :test_tube: **Example**: `subdevice_role: parent`
- `comments`: A string field which allows for comments to be added to the device. (**Default: None**)
  - Type: String
> :test_tube: **Example**: `comments: This is a comment that will appear on all NetBox devices of this type`
- `weight`: An array with a **single** item that allow for a value and unit of measurement to be defined. (**Default: None**)
  - Type: Array
  - Value: Number - must be multiple of 0.01
  - Unit: String
    - Options:
        - kg
        - g
        - lb
        - oz
>:test_tube: **Example**:
>```
>weight:
>  - value: 12.21
>    unit: lb
>```

## Data Validation / Commit Quality Checks

There are two ways this repo focuses on keeping quality device-type definitions:

- **Pre-Commit Checks** - Optional, but **highly recommended**, for helping to identify simple issues before committing. (trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer, check-yaml, yamlfmt, yamllint)
  - Installation
    - Virtual Environment Route
      - It is recommended to create a virtual env for your repo (`python3 -m venv venv`)
      - Install the required pip packages (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
      - Continue to the "Install `pre-commit` Hooks"

    - To uninstall the pre-commit script: `pre-commit uninstall`
  - Learn more about [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- **GitHub Actions** - Automatically run before a PR can be merged. Repeats yamllint & validates against NetBox Device-Type Schema.
